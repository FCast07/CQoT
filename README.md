# Critical-Questions-of-Thought: Steering LLM reasoning with Argumentative Querying

Combining argumentation theories, leveraging Toulmin's argument schema and the notions of critical questions, with the test-time compute paradigm enables LLMs' higher performances on logical and mathematical tasks. In particular, the probing action of the critical questions allows the model to adjust its reasoning plan, thus effectively correcting itself in case of wrong assumptions or thinking steps. The ensuing approach, denoted as _Critical-Questions-of-Thought (CQoT)_, is composed of a pipeline rendered herein as a Python script.  



We share the results achieved by the CQoT method as detailed in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15177).
